/**
 * BoxTest is a glassbox test of the Box class. 
 *
 * Recall that like a BallContainer, the Box is a container for Balls and you
 * can only put a Ball into a Box once. After you put the Ball into
 * the Box, further attempts to do so will fail, since the Ball is
 * already in the Box! Similarly, you cannot expect to remove a Ball
 * from a Box if it is not inside the Box.
 *
 * In addition, a Box differs from a ballcontainer because it only has a finite
 * capacity. As Balls get put into a Box, it gets filled up. Once a Box
 * is full, further attempts to put Balls into the Box will also fail.
